# QuickQuiz — BCA Minor Project (5th Sem)

## Project summary
QuickQuiz is a small multiple-choice web quiz built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
It demonstrates front-end fundamentals and is suitable for a minor project submission.

## Files in repository
- `index.html` — main web page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — quiz logic (questions, scoring)
- `REPORT.md` — project report (summary, installation, screenshots)
- `SOURCE_CODE.pdf` — (optional) PDF containing full source code (generated if environment allowed)
- `submission_instructions.md` — how to prepare GitHub repo and create source code PDF

## How to run locally
1. Extract the zip.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. No server is required; this is a static site.

## How to submit on GitHub
1. Create a new repository (e.g. `bca-quickquiz`).
2. Add all files, commit and push.
3. Use GitHub Pages to host `index.html` (Settings → Pages → Source: main branch / root).
4. Include `REPORT.md` in the repo root and attach a `SOURCE_CODE.pdf` in the repo or a `docs/` folder.
